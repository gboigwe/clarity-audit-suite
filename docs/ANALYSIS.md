# Clarity Contract Analysis Details

This document explains how the Clarity Contract Audit Suite analyzes smart contracts and what issues it can detect.

## Analysis Categories

### 1. Unused Code Detection

The analyzer identifies unused elements that can bloat your contract and increase gas costs:

- **Unused Functions**: Private functions that are defined but never called
- **Unused Constants**: Constants that are defined but never referenced
- **Unused Variables**: Data variables that are defined but never used
- **Unused Maps**: Map definitions that are never accessed

**Why it matters**: Unused code increases contract size and complexity without providing value. Removing it can make contracts more maintainable and potentially reduce gas costs.

### 2. Unsafe Operations

The analyzer identifies potentially unsafe operations:

- **Unwrap Without Error Handling**: Uses of `unwrap!` or `unwrap-panic` that might cause runtime errors
- **Potential Division by Zero**: Division operations that might not have proper checks

**Why it matters**: These operations can cause contract execution to fail unexpectedly, potentially locking funds or breaking functionality.

### 3. Naming Conventions

The analyzer ensures adherence to Clarity naming conventions:

- **Function Naming**: Functions should use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Variable Naming**: Variables and constants should follow consistent naming patterns

**Why it matters**: Following consistent naming conventions makes contracts more readable and maintainable.

### 4. Contract Metrics

The analyzer calculates important metrics about your contract:

- **Function Count**: Total number of functions broken down by visibility
- **Map Count**: Number of maps defined in the contract
- **Constant Count**: Number of constants defined
- **Variable Count**: Number of data variables defined
- **Complexity Score**: A measure of contract complexity based on function size and parameter count

**Why it matters**: These metrics help you understand the overall structure and complexity of your contract.

## How It Works

The analysis process follows these steps:

1. **Parsing**: The contract source code is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
2. **AST Analysis**: The AST is traversed to identify patterns and issues
3. **Issue Collection**: Detected issues are collected with severity levels and remediation suggestions
4. **Metric Calculation**: Contract metrics are calculated from the AST
5. **Report Generation**: A comprehensive report is generated in the requested format

## Example Issues

Here are examples of issues the analyzer can detect:

### Unused Private Function
```clarity
;; This function is defined but never called
(define-private (calculate-interest (balance uint))
  (let ((rate u5))
    (/ (* balance rate) u100)
  )
)
```

### Unsafe Unwrap
```clarity
;; This unwrap! could fail at runtime
(define-public (transfer-tokens (amount uint) (recipient principal))
  (begin
    (unwrap! (ft-transfer? token amount tx-sender recipient) (err u104))
    (ok true)
  )
)
```

### Potential Division by Zero
```clarity
;; If rate is set to 0, this would cause a division by zero error
(define-private (calculate-percentage (value uint) (rate uint))
  (/ (* value u100) rate)
)
```

## Planned Future Analysis

In future versions, we plan to add:

1. **Reentrancy Detection**: Identify potential reentrancy vulnerabilities
2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Detect potential numeric overflows
3. **Authorization Checks**: Ensure proper sender verification
4. **Gas Optimization**: Suggest ways to optimize contract gas usage
5. **Formal Verification**: Mathematically prove contract properties

## Contributing New Checks

To add a new type of check to the analyzer:

1. Create a new method in the `StaticAnalyzer` class
2. Implement the logic to identify the issue pattern
3. Return an array of `AnalysisIssue` objects
4. Add your method to the `analyze` method's list of checks
5. Add tests for your new check

For example:

```typescript
private checkFunctionSize(ast: ClarityAst): AnalysisIssue[] {
  const issues: AnalysisIssue[] = [];
  const functions = AstUtils.findNodesByType(ast, 'function-definition') as FunctionDefinition[];
  
  for (const func of functions) {
    if (func.body.length > 20) {
      issues.push({
        type: 'large-function',
        severity: 'info',
        message: `Function '${func.name}' is very large (${func.body.length} expressions)`,
        suggestion: 'Consider breaking this function into smaller, more focused functions.'
      });
    }
  }
  
  return issues;
}
```
